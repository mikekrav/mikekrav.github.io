                    <p>Wine-O is a game I am developing for wine enthusiasts and novices alike. Born out of game I played in Tuscany on one of my first wine tastings, and a desire to get my hands dirty and learn about app development (and become an expert on prompt engineer - thanks Chat.GPT and Claude).</p>
                    
                    <p>While discover my love for wine - and meeting people who work in the industry (or other big fans of the industry), I saw a huge knowledge gap about between those who we would consider 'snobs' and people who enjoy it, but never had the opportunity to geek out on it. Despite that gap, so many people I've met have had the desire to learn more (while also relaxing and enjoying their wine.)</p>
                    
                    <p>The spirits industry is at an interesting place as Americans are drinking less each year, but the wine market has continued to flourish as has those customers who are looking for a drink they can enjoy, is high in quality, and provides an experience that goes beyond your Moms bottle of barefoot.</p>
                    
                    <p>Wine-O is still under development, but it will be launching for beta testing this spring (as will my article on how and why I built it — shameless plug to my medium feed).</p>

                    <p>You may already be familiar with this project, as you're in it right now!</p>
                    
                    <p>The product management market has had a rough go of it the past few years, and it's brought a need to stand out and showcase your skills outside of your day to day work.</p>
                    
                    <p>My goal with this portfolio was three fold:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Build a personal website / portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and writing</li>
                        <li>Deviate from the norm by showcasing my style and creativity</li>
                        <li>Not write a single line of code</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Thanks to the magic that is Claude Sonnet 3.7, I was able to build the framework for this website in all of 30 minutes. Spending about 2 hours writing content, gathering images, and generating some others using (image ai), I was able to have this guy up in running in about half a days time (I might have left out the hour it took me to learn how GitHub works - oops).</p>
                    
                    <p>I am proud of this project as it gives me a space to showcase my accomplishments, love for product, and connect with others who feel the same way.</p>

                    <p>My introduction into website design came from a simple request and a lot of free time during COVID: help me make my new business look professional.</p>
                    
                    <p>The owner of Finn's Up Charters decided to open his business after moving to a new state and fulfilling his dream of becoming a boat captain.</p>
                    
                    <p>The owner had a tremendous history of word of mouth sales and building a customer base through personal relationships; however, the combination of a new state and Covid lockdowns prevented him from taking off.</p>
                    
                    <p>I built him a website to provide a personal, friendly, and professional image that advertised his work and his story.</p>
                    
                    <p>I built this website using squarespace, grammar, and a few YouTube videos to make it look professionally done. I will take pride in the image selection - some of which I found free online and others I took myself.</p>
